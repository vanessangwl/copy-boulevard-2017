#### Blvd BO (Coming Soon)

##### About
A surprise for two, coming soon near you.

[comment]: # (lifted from Prive: Modern French Grill, Privé Grill, specializes in French-inspired cuisine given a modern twist. Aside from an extensive selection of perfectly-cooked charcoal-grilled meats, diners can also look forward to scrumptious starters, hearty mains and a decadent dessert buffet that are all part of a very affordable 2-course ($48) and 3-course ($58) set dinner. On weekdays, set lunches are also available with some of the best views in Singapore. The interior of Privé Grill is itself a haven of quiet sophistication which exudes warmth and intimacy. Accented by Grand Blotch Damask Wallpaper and Flos lamps, it is the ideal place to enjoy a gourmet meal while taking in sweeping views of the beautiful marina and the surrounding lush greenery.)
