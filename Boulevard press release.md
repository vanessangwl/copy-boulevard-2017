# BOULEVARD XX: A NEW RESTAURANT BY SINGAPORE'S <insert adjective and stuff>

Stephen Starr, one of the country's top restaurateurs, and Chef Masaharu Morimoto, star of television's immensely popular cooking show Iron Chef, opened Morimoto, a brilliant restaurant featuring contemporary Japanese cuisine, at 723 Chestnut Street.

To complete their visionary team and develop the original concept, Starr hired world-renowned designer Karim Rashid. Throughout the space, he blends traditional Japanese design with organic and sensual elements. With his cutting-edge design, Rashid stimulates and awakens the senses.

"Rashid's unusual surroundings set the stage for the inspired cuisine of Chef Morimoto," says Starr, who is credited with bringing two other high-concept Asian restaurants, Buddakan and Pod, to Philadelphia.

Chef Morimoto, who has earned international respect for his extraordinary cuisine, integrates Western ingredients and techniques with traditional Japanese cooking such as tempura, sushi, sashimi and yakimono. A selection of private label sakes compliments Chef Morimoto's sophisticated menu.

"The cuisine at my new restaurant goes beyond everything I have ever created. I am introducing new preparations that incorporate ingredients rarely tasted outside of Japan," says Chef Morimoto, who recently left his position of six years as Executive Chef at the highly acclaimed Nobu restaurant in New York City. Since 1998, he has become famous for his exciting performances as the "Silver Iron Chef" on the Japanese produced Iron Chef that airs nationally on the Food Network, earning international acclaim for his remarkable ability to prepare numerous elaborate and original dishes.

The restaurant's symmetrical design features geometric booths with glass dividers. Large amorphous shapes and a soft egg-shaped sculpture emerge from smooth white plaster walls. Dark brown bamboo covers the floors and the curvy, undulating ceiling that rises up to 22'. Colored glass tables with white leather benches, seat up to 125 people. Guests enjoy viewing the artistry of Chef Morimoto and his staff of experts working at the 15-seat yellow glass, box-shaped sushi bar.

A brightly lit, three-dimensional image of a Japanese woman greets guests as they enter. An abstract 5' fiberglass sculpture, personally designed by Rashid, rests in the foyer. A mezzanine level bar area, nestled under the restaurant's curvy ceiling, seats up to 30 people and offers a window for guests to look out over the main dining room. The space features a resin bar and white leather banquettes.
A separate private room holds up to 16 people. Magically lit, the enclosed space glows in soft light.

Multi-talented Rashid, considered a pioneer of the American design industry, has been designing products, packaging, furni- ture and interiors since 1984. Rashid's work has been featured in museum collections and exhibitions around the world. An Associate Professor of Industrial Design at University of the Arts in Philadelphia, Rashid has designed many famous products for such clients as Sony, Umbra, Nambe and Issey Miyake.

Chef Morimoto, born and raised in Hiroshima, Japan, learned the art of sushi and traditional Kaiseki cuisine by training under several of his country's esteemed master chefs. After being the chef-owner of a restaurant in Japan for five years, Chef Morimoto moved to New York City to explore Western cooking styles. Fifteen years later, he has become well known for his unsurpassed culinary talent. Among Chef Morimoto's passions is his collection of traditional Japanese culinary tools. Recently, Ralph Lauren designed his new chef wear.

Morimoto is the seventh restaurant for Starr, owner of the trend setting Starr Restaurant Organization. A master of ultra-chic concepts and sensational interior design, Starr has taken the city's dining scene to exciting new heights with his successful restaurant group that includes: Jones, a casual comfort-food restaurant and lounge; the Cuban inspired Alma de Cuba; the smash-hit modern Asian Buddakan; the ever-popular Continental Restaurant and Martini Bar; the breathtaking Mediterranean fantasy Tangerine; and the futuristic Asian Pod. Starr and Chef Morimoto also have plans to open a second Morimoto in New York City next year.

Morimoto, located at 723 Chestnut Street, serves lunch Monday to Friday, 11:30 am to 2 pm. Dinner is served seven nights a week: Monday to Thursday, 5 pm to 11 pm; Friday and Saturday, 5 pm to 12 midnight; and Sunday, 4 pm to 10 pm. For reservations or more information, please call 215.413.9070.
