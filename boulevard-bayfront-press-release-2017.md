# BOULEVARD BAYFRONT – THE THIRD GASTRONOMY BAR WITH COCKTAIL-HEAVY & FINE WINE CONCEPT AT MARINA BAY FINANCIAL CENTRE

SINGAPORE, JUNE 2011 

BOULEVARD unfolded its third flagship outlet at the new iconic financial hub of Singapore – Marina Bay Financial Centre. Launched early of this year, its name BOULEVARD BAYFRONT is inspired by the frontal view of the Marina Bay and the relevance of its neighboring road name, Bayfront Avenue.

BOULEVARD BAYFRONT is the premier league of gastronomy bar in comparison to its sister outlets – BOULEVARD RESTROBAR & CRAFTBEER. The chic and trendy designer-like interior, dazzling unblocked view of the Marina Bay Waterfront, accompanying bar cuisine of Tapas and Stone-Fired Handmade Pizza, and a polished fine wine list are the reasons for the draw of this place.

BOULEVARD BAYFRONT embodies both the pleasures of Gourmet and Wine with a phenomenal offering of a voguish welcoming interior that sets to comfort guests in suits and coats; immersing each and every in the soulful music beats of chill and down tempo.

The dazzling Alfresco Dining under the stars with breathtaking view of the Marina Bay view is set to welcome patronizing guests in early July 2011.

Set in the busy Financial District area, BOULEVARD BAYFRONT offers a breather from the fast paced city with its hospitable atmosphere and luscious comfort of fine wine & bar cuisine. Nestled within the MARINA BAY FINANCIAL CENTRE and just on foot distance from the MARINA BAY SANDS INTERGRATED RESORT, provides a haven for the business community, locals and overseas guests alike.
